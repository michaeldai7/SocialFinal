						<h2>Overview</h2>

							Climate change is getting more and more <em>oblivious</em> these days due to the activity of human is becoming more and more dramatic these days.
						</p1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p2>The most focused problem of climate change is Global Warming because it has the most obvious evidence but yet, there are <em> also many problems </em>.</p2>
					</section>

						<h2>Past, Present and Future</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Past</h2>
						<p>The climate change due to human activity was started science early 1800s and was first suspected as a natural greenhouse effect. But rhe increasing number of carbon dioxide and warming effect had became convincing, therefore the climate change had become a real thing.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Present</h2>
						<p>Most are realizing the problem of climate change and many governments had already take some action to slow down the rate of climate change but never have a effective to completely to stop climate change.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Future</h2>
						<p>1.5Â°C of the temperature rising could cause irreversible effect on Earth.</p>
